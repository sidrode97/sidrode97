# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Siddharth Rao Deb

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer focused on NLP, neural retrieval, and generative AI. Iâ€™m a builder: I study the theory and then implement end-to-end systems. This page highlights longer, production-style projects that grew out of smaller study exercises.

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

### [FinQA RAG Agent](https://github.com/sidrode97/finqa-rag-agent)
An intelligent financial question-answering agent that uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for accurate, context-aware answers. Built with LangChain, OpenAI, and custom scoring/retrieval pipelines.  
_Origin:_ Evolved from my [RAG mini-project](https://github.com/sidrode97/RAG) exploring retrievers, re-rankers, and evaluation.

### [LLM-Enhanced Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST-cascaded)](https://github.com/sidrode97/S2ST-cascaded)
**Masterâ€™s capstone (RIT).** A modular pipeline that turns **English audio** into **Hindi/Korean/Spanish speech**. Stack: Wav2Vec2 **ASR** â†’ BERT-Large **LLM cleanup** â†’ mBART-50 **MT** â†’ VITS/MMS-**TTS**. Designed for debuggabilityâ€”each stage is swappable and easy to inspect.

## ðŸ§© Mini-Projects (Selected)

- [RAG](https://github.com/sidrode97/RAG) â€” Prototyped RAG building blocks (BM25 vs. embeddings, cross-encoder re-ranking, evaluation) that underpin the FinQA RAG Agent.

Stay tuned for more updates and projects!
